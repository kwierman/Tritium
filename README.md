=========

A tritium calculation engine

**_Note: Still in code design. Engine does not build, only design components._**

**_Note: Backwards compatibility will be broken on migration to Protium and Deuterium._**

#Notes On Dimensional Analysis

Tritium Implements a system of meaningful dimensional analysis.

This supports conversion between dimensions using the `*` and `/` operators.
